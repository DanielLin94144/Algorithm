The Wise Man
智者

People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same
problems every time. One day he told them a joke and everyone roared
in laughter.
人們一直來到智者面前，每次都抱怨同樣的問題。 有一天，他給他們講了一個笑
話，每個人都哄堂大笑。

After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few
of them smiled.
幾分鐘後，他給他們講了同樣的笑話，只有幾個人笑了。

When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore.
當他第三次講同樣的笑話時，沒有人笑了。

The wise man smiled and said:
"You can't laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you
always crying about the same problem?"
智者笑道：
“你不能一遍又一遍地笑同一個笑話。那你為什麼總是為同樣的問題哭呢？”

The Four Smart Students
四個聰明的學生

One night four college students were out partying late night and
didn't study for the test which was scheduled for the next day. In
the morning, they thought of a plan.
一天晚上，四名大學生深夜出去聚會，沒有為第二天安排的考試而學習。 早上，
他們想到了一個計劃。

They made themselves look dirty with grease and dirt.
他們用油脂和污垢使自己看起來很髒。

Then they went to the Dean and said they had gone out to a wedding
last night and on their way back the tire of their car burst and they
had to push the car all the way back. So they were in no condition to
take the test.
然後他們去找院長，說他們昨晚出去參加了一個婚禮，在回來的路上，他們的車
輪胎爆了，他們不得不把車一直推回去。 所以他們沒有條件參加考試。

The Dean thought for a minute and said they can have the re-test
after 3 days. They thanked him and said they will be ready by that
time.
院長想了想，說三天后可以復試。 他們向他表示感謝，並說到那時他們會準備好
。

On the third day, they appeared before the Dean. The Dean said that
as this was a Special Condition Test, all four were required to sit
in separate classrooms for the test. They all agreed as they had
prepared well in the last 3 days.
第三天，他們出現在院長面前。 院長說，由於這是一項特殊條件測試，所有四個
人都被要求坐在不同的教室進行測試。 他們都同意了，因為他們在過去的三天裡
準備得很好。

The Test has only one question: Which tire burst?
測試只有一個問題：哪個輪胎爆了？
